# Data Analysis Project (in R) - Spotify hit songs (Introduction to Statistics)   
That's my 1st EDA project, based on my main 1st year university course - Introduction to Statistics.   
I used most of the main subjects I learned in my 1st year (Mentioned in Topics).  

The project is based on "Spotify 2010-1019 Top Hits list" dataset from Kaggle.  
My main question is - How a songs genre contribute to a song popularity?  

Therefore, the main connection I will try to examine is between **songs genres** and **the amount of time it takes to become a hit**.   
The operational variables will be the main categorical genre's of songs and number 
of years it took for the song to enter the list. 

My whole way of thinking is integrated into the notes in the R-code.
